So I had a look at static site generators like Jekyll, but since Hugo is built on Go, I settled for Hugo.\nAt first I had some troubles with settling for a theme, because there are quite a few out there.\nHarbor looked really nice, but I had to fix the example config.toml file first before really using it.\nAnyways check out my instrument tuner which I wrote a while ago.\n"
