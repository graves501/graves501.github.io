			<description>First post! So I had a look at static site generators like Jekyll, but since Hugo is built on Go, I settled for Hugo.
At first I had some troubles with settling for a theme, because there are quite a few out there.
Harbor looked really nice, but I had to fix the example config.toml file first before really using it.
Anyways check out my instrument tuner which I wrote a while ago.</description>
